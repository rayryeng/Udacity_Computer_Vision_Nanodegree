# Udacity_Computer_Vision_Nanodegree

This repo contains my work for the Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree Program.  Each directory contains a project required for completion and also contains instructions on what is expected to complete each project successfully.  Also note that the code uses PyTorch 1.x and not 0.x so some slight changes were made to ensure the code runs.

## Project #1 - Facial Keypoints Detection

The goal of this project is to detect where the facial keypoints are on a face image by designing an appropriate deep neural network to directly regress their locations on the face.  The relevant models, notebooks and results can be found in `Facial-Keypoint-Detection-P1`.   The trained model for this project has been committed via Git LFS so this will need to be installed if you want to grab the model.

Please visit <https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation> to install Git LFS. Once you do, after you clone this repo, please use the following to download the weights.

```sh
$ cd <path to this repo>
$ git lfs fetch
```
