Then you are ready to compress your files and submit your solution!\n\nThe following steps assume:\n1. All cells have been *run* in Notebooks 2 and 3 (and that progress has been saved).\n2. All questions in those notebooks have been answered.\n3. Your architecture in `model.py` is your best tested architecture.\n\nPlease make sure all your work is saved before moving on. You do not need to change any code in these cells; this code is to help you submit your project, only.\n\n---\n\nThe first thing we'll do, is convert your notebooks into `.html` files; these files will save the output of each cell and any code/text that you have modified and saved in those notebooks. Note that the first notebooks are not included because their contents will not affect your project review.","metadata":{"cell_id":"8ab42274-c8d4-40e8-ae0c-40481219418e"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"500b1b95-8548-427f-9bcd-defd6b109131"},"source":"!jupyter nbconvert \"2_Training.ipynb\"\n!jupyter nbconvert \"3_Inference.ipynb\"","execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"[NbConvertApp] Converting notebook 2_Training.ipynb to html\n[NbConvertApp] Writing 317873 bytes to 2_Training.html\n[NbConvertApp] Converting notebook 3_Inference.ipynb to html\n[NbConvertApp] Writing 1153868 bytes to 3_Inference.html\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Zip the project files\n\nNext, we'll zip all these notebook files and your `model.py` file into one compressed archive named `project2.zip`.\n\nAfter completing this step you should see this zip file appear in your home directory, where you can download it as seen in the image below, by selecting it from the list and clicking **Download**.
